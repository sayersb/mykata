Rick and Morty go on adventures all the time, across numerous time lines and universes. 

As Rick is the reason for most of these adventures it has been agreed that 1 in every 10 adventures are chosen by Morty.

This rule however only came to pass after the 19th adventure, making the 20th the first official Morty adventure.

State whether the adventure in question is a Rick or Morty adventure.

Note that we will only go up to 208 adventures, giving them enough time to complete an adventure a week since they started until now.

We don't know if the adventures after 208 are chosen by Rick or Morty because sadly due to the nature of the work one of them might not make it through the next adventure!
